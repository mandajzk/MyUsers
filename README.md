__MyUsers - User Management App__

__UPDATE:__ Newbies, please understand that this is a starting point for a tutorial I am in the process of writing for creating secure user I/O systems. This code is a starting point ONLY and has security flaws that will be resolved within the tutorial. This is for learning purposes and should be considered not secure enough to just copy and paste into your site! For example, I have NOT addressed SQL injection AT ALL YET. Thanks for your interest but this is NOT a complete, ready to use app. Not just yet!

MyUsers is my simple user management system using PHP & MySQL. Definitely WIP...

Features to come in order of cuz i said so:

- __Displayed Name Support__ - _Done, this has been added now_<br>Not just displaying a username, this is greeting a user like "Hello, Bob" or "Hello Nancy".
- __User Level Support__ - _Done, this has been added now_<br>Adding the restrictions needed to display or not certain pages or content based on user level. The demo will only show the "Manage Users" option to admin level users. [View demo here.] (http://myusers-cp.redhousewd.com/)
- __Automatic Password Recovery__ - _in the works_<br>The whole enter your email/reset your password bit, standard fare really.
- __User Account Verification__ - _on the drawing board_<br>Sends the email with the verify link.
- __Multiple Demos__ - _2 of 3 demos are complete:_ [view control panel demo] (http://myusers-cp.redhousewd.com/) | [view members only demo] (http://myusers-mo.redhousewd.com/)<br>3 Demos based on their application like a [standalone CP] (http://myusers-cp.redhousewd.com/), a [members only website] (http://myusers-mo.redhousewd.com/) or a community driven site.
- __Cleaning / Updating / jQuery / Ajax__ - _in the works, some cleaning done already_<br>This is a few years old. Time to clean up the code and modernize everything.<br>Would use sockets if browser support was better, just sayin.

More to come soon, stay tuned. This is going into an app and being sorted out as we, ummm, type...
