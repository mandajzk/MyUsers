__MyUsers - User Management App__

MyUsers is my simple user management system using PHP & MySQL. Definitely WIP...

Features to come in order of cuz i said so:

- __Displayed Name Support__ - _Done, this has been added now_<br>Not just displaying a username, this is greeting a user like "Hello, Bob" or "Hello Nancy".
- __User Level Support__ - _Done, this has been added now_<br>Adding the restrictions needed to display or not certain pages or content based on user level. Will be updating the demo shortly to only show the "Manage Users" option to admin level users.
- __Automatic Password Recovery__ - _in the works_<br>The whole enter your email/reset your password bit, standard fare really.
- __User Account Verification__ - _on the drawing board_<br>Sends the email with the verify link.
- __Multiple Demos__ - _standalone CP is in the works_<br>3 Demos based on their application like a standalone CP or a community driven site.
- __Cleaning / Updating / jQuery / Ajax__ - _on the drawing board_<br>This is a few years old. Time to clean up the code and modernize everything.<br>Would use sockets if browser support was better, just sayin.

More to come soon, stay tuned. This is going into an app and being sorted out as we, ummm, type...
