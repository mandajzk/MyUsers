## MyUsers ##

MyUsers is my simple user management system using PHP & MySQL. Definitely WIP...

Features to come in order of cuz i said so:

- Displayed Name Support (not just displaying a username, this is greeting a user like "Hello, Bob" or "Hello Nancy") - in the works
- User Level Support (adding the restrictions needed to display or not certain pages or content based on user level) - in the works
- Automatic Password Recovery (the whole enter your email/reset your password bit, standard fare) - in the works
- User Account Verification (sends the email with the verify link) - on the drawing board

More to come soon, stay tuned. This is going into an app and being sorted out as we, ummm, type...
