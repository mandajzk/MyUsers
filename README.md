__MyUsers - User Management App__

MyUsers is my simple user management system using PHP & MySQL. Definitely WIP...

Features to come in order of cuz i said so:

- __Displayed Name Support__<br>Not just displaying a username, this is greeting a user like "Hello, Bob" or "Hello Nancy". - _in the works_
- __User Level Support__<br>Adding the restrictions needed to display or not certain pages or content based on user level. - _in the works_
- __Automatic Password Recovery__<br>The whole enter your email/reset your password bit, standard fare really. - _in the works_
- __User Account Verification__<br>Sends the email with the verify link. - _on the drawing board_
- __Multiple Demos__<br>3 Demos based on their application like a standalone CP or a community driven site. - _standalone CP is in the works_
- __Cleaning/Updating/jQuery/Ajax__<br>This is a few years old. Time to clean up the code and modernize everything. Would use sockets if browser support was better, just sayin. - _on the drawing board_

More to come soon, stay tuned. This is going into an app and being sorted out as we, ummm, type...
