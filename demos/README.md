__Demos Section README__

The demos are not ready yet but the demos (when released) will each be a downloadable "framework" (as overused as that word is these days) for starting that kind of project. Project demos will be for the following types of projects.

- __A Standalone Control Panel__<br>_DONE!_ - [View Demo](http://myusers-cp.redhousewd.com/)<br>A complete app with only a "log in" homepage, when users log out they redirect to the homepage. All other pages are protected.
- __A Members Only site__<br>_DONE!_ - [View Demo](http://myusers-mo.redhousewd.com/)<br>Will only display certain pages for unregistered users, such as home, about us, sign up or register but all other content is restricted.
- __A Community based site__<br>_in the planning stages_<br>Will allow surfing for anyone, but only registered users can interact like a forum or message board.

__Keep an eye on this__ as these will be updated as my schedule allows.
